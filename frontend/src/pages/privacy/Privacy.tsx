          <em>Cookies, Beacons and Analytics</em>
          <br />
          When you interact with the Services, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. Our Services uses
          technology, or those of third-party service providers, such as cookies, web beacons (clear GIFs, web bugs) and
          similar technologies to track user activity and collect site data. We may combine this data with the Personal
          Information we have collected from you.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>Cookies</em>
          <br />
          We (including our chosen third-party service providers) use cookies to track visitor activity on the Services.
          A cookie is a text file that a website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
          Our cookies assign a random, unique number to each visitor's computer. They do not contain information that
          would personally identify the visitor, although we can associate a cookie with any identifying information
          that is or has been provided to us while visiting the Services. We use cookies that remain on your computer
          for a specified period of time or until they are deleted (persistent cookies). We may also use cookies that
          exist only temporarily during an online session (session cookies) – these cookies allow us to identify you
          temporarily as you move through the Services. Most browsers allow users to refuse cookies but doing so may
          impede the functionality of some portions of our Services.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>Web Beacons</em>
          <br />
          Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track
          the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, Web
          beacons are embedded invisibly on webpages and may not be disabled or controlled through your browser.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>Third Parties</em>
          <br />
          We may also engage third parties to track and analyze Services activity on our behalf. To do so, these third
          parties may place cookies or web beacons to track user activity on our Services. We use the data collected by
          such third parties to administer and improve the quality of the Services, analyze usage of the Services, and
          provide a more enhanced user experience on the Services, such as personalizing and delivering relevant offers
          and content based on user activity on the Services. We do not provide these third parties with your Personal
          Information.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may use third party analytics services (such as Google Analytics and other similar services) to collect and
          process certain analytics data. These services may also collect information about your use of other websites,
          apps, and online resources.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>User Content</em>
          <br />
          The Services allow users to post information. Any information that you post to the Services becomes public
          information and may be viewable by other users, as well as visitors to the Services. In addition, your name,
          as well as other optional information you choose to submit along with the information you post, will be
          publicly displayed along with your comment or blog. We are not responsible for the privacy of any information
          that you choose to post to the Services, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings.
          We cannot prevent such information from being used by others in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy,
          the law, or your personal privacy. Your posting of any content to any of the Services is subject to our Terms
          of Use.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>Third-Party Links</em>
          <br />
          The Services contain links to other, third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is
          not governed by this Privacy Policy, but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party
          websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites. <br />
          <br />
          <em>Email Policy</em>
          <br />
          We may use your email address to communicate with you about orders you have placed, inquiries you have made
          about our products and services, or information you have shared with us through the Services or email. We may
          send you emails from time-to-time, about information that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also
          send you news and offers about our products and services, or those of our chosen partners. Examples include,
          but are not limited to, our blog, newsletter, information about special offers, or other products or
          offerings.
          <br />
          <br />
          If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving these promotional emails, you may follow the opt-out
          instructions contained in any such e-mail. Please note that it may take a few business days for us to process
          opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails or promotions, we still may send you emails to you in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy, as requested by you, or in reference to other customer service purposes.
          <br />
          <br />

          Services, you are consenting to and authorizing the transfer of your information to the United States for
          storage, use, processing, maintenance and onward transfer of such information to other entities, regardless of
          their location, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the other applicable Terms. For clarity, and as
          outlined in the Terms, you are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters
          concerning the Services.

          measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.

          <br />
          If you are a resident of California and interact with us as a consumer, you have certain rights under the

          show ads within their systems that are targeted to your interests. To opt out of having your Personal
          Information used for targeted advertising purposes, please email us at founders@trycoaster.com.
